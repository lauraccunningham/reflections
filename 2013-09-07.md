**Weekly Reflection**

_What happens in the classroom does not stay in the classroom. What obstacles did you encounter? How did you go about fixing the problem? Who helped (people, links, etc.)?_

-----

When you mentioned on the first day of class the public nature of this course, I originally thought "Oh, How cool" but also that it would be a little strange.  Since we all attend Cal, I think it is safe to say we are all a little bit nerdy and enjoy learning for the sake of learning and absorbing knowledge.  At first though, I didn't put myself in the shoes of those who may be on the outside looking in, and realize that my education here at Cal has afforded me opportunities to be a part of a larger dialogue that I see you are extending to a more diversity and broad base.  The absorption of knowledge takes place through various mediums, and with our class' Internet presence, I believe we will be able to expand the knowledge we search for outside of our university's confines.  Currently, GitHub seems like a vast black hole of knowledge that just needs a little sifting through, but can positively impact the changing viewpoints and perspectives of people beyond Cal's reach.  Slowly, in time I believe that GitHub will prove to be beneficial to our class' research and understanding outsiders' perspectives.

Just as we research reports, produce projects, and deliver presentations, our knowledge comes to a halt without expanding our base to an outside-the-classroom community.  We halt progress and cease to develop and produce what could have been a great idea.  Collaboration would produce such power if only we were able to expose our research and ideas on a global platform.  As they say, two minds are better than one, and could you imagine a hundred or more picking apart a single problem from numerous angles and points of view.  By now we would have a perfect collaboration and could have developed a cure for some of the most pressing disease in real time.  Unfortunately, economic advantages, rights, and more ways of getting a leg up on someone have pressed our collaborative, utopic ideals into a race for notoriety and fame.

Beginning this course with a perfectly clean slate, and I mean a brand new computer, has allowed me to start from scratch - newly downloaded materials precisely organized and set up with particular settings that are updated to my needs has helped me begin my academic semester calm and collected.  So far, the downloading of standard materials has been tedious, but is setting me up for success.  With our professor's guidance, Aaron Culich met with me to reinstall general software on my new computer and get ready to delve into my classes required programming software and simple text editors.  Even new programs were added to my machine with advice from peers and our professor, Aaron Culich.

Within the confines of Statistics 157, the signing up of accounts including: GitHub, Feedly, Twitter, Freenode IRC, and VirtualBox having been quite straightforward. Within each account some points of confusion arose, but nothing too serious that I can not figure out with help or familiarizing myself with each interface.  With time is how I presume people generally work more cohesively and continue to become experts of the formats each independently.  Time can only tell how things will continue.  With the downloading and installation of the Github Client, Adium, VirtualBox, the Ubuntu Server, and iPython Notebook within VirtualBox I believe all of us students have had their points with difficulty, moments of confusion, but with guidance from Aaron Culich and our teaching assistants we have been able to get up to speed in class and at home - well almost.  Here are an itemized listing of my problems and actions thus far in the semester accumulated from our online class page from Statistics 157, Reproducible & Collaborative Data Science. https://github.com/stat157 ( **Bolded features will express troubled points with new material thus far** and *italicized explanations of my understanding, progress, and troubles so far are highlighted below.*)

- [ ] GitHub 
	- Creating an account
	- Becoming more familiar with the GitHub interface with
	- Creating Repositories & Commits
	- Forking Repositories
	- **Pull Requests**
	- **Cloning Repositories, through commands**
		- *Pull Requests and Cloning in GitHub's online interface was a little confusing to understand exactly what was happening and where things were going.*
		- *Slowly, these little questions will clear up over time and with familiarity of GitHub.*
- [ ] GitHub Client
	- Installation & Set Up
	- Updating, Syncing
	- Cloning Repositories, in the Desktop
- [ ] Feedly
	- Creating an account
	- Subscribing to blog feeds:
		- 'github.com/blog', 'blog.feedly.com', 'planet.pidgin.im' (Linux / Microsoft version of Adium - important to be aware of our collaborators' programs status), 'adium.im/blog' (OS version), 'blog.freenode.net'.
- [ ] Twitter
	- Creating an account
	- Following:
		- @GitHubStatus https://twitter.com/githubstatus
		- @FreenodeStaff https://twitter.com/freenodestaff
- [ ] Freenode, IRC
	- **Creating an account**
		- *At freenode.net you will come to a standstill in trying to create an account - confusing at first, but with someone with previous knowledge at my side, the process was seamless and easy to understand.*
	- Utilizing IRC for positive collaboration and feedback opportunities
- [ ] Adium (OS X version; download Pidgin at this stage as the Linux/Windows option)
	- Downloading & Installation
	- **Registering a NickName**, Freenode IRC platform
		- *A little tricky at first, but simple with prompted instructions ( __/register__ )*
	- Understanding of features:
		- Joining a group chat ( __/join #groupName__, in our case, we are using #Stat157 as our class chat page - i.e. __/join #stat157__)
		- Starting a personal chat
- [ ] VirtualBox
	- Downloading & Installation
	- **Setting Up of a 'computer within a computer'**
		- *Why do we need to do this?  Security.  Makes sense, just a little confusing with the many prompts but achievable to set up with the knowledge of defaults we want to avoid and agree to.*
- [ ] Ubuntu Server
	- Downloading & Set-Up
		- Make sure you are downloading the correct server image and not the incorrect package.  Standardizing this with the class will make future progress much easier to follow and understand.
	- Understanding of what it means to be 
- [ ] iPython Notebook
	- Downloading within VirtualBox
	- Exploring within VirtualBox
	- **Exploring iPython Notebook within our browser for easy access**
		- *Today in class, set up proved to be difficult for many, and not just me, so hopefully the process of producing iPython with my browser next time will work and have no lag time.*

In time, I feel confident I will be able to understand each action I am putting into my computer as well as absorbing a volume of knowledge within the spheres of Computer Science, Statistics, and Collaborative Data Science community by the end of the semester.  Although complete mastery of each topic we delve into will be difficult chunks of understand will always prove to be helpful as part of my academic arsenal.
