_Comparing Earthquake Data to Other Examples_

-----

There doesn't seem to be a clear-cut example of how to examine earthquake data.  For us, we've looked at comparable examples of data analysis, yet only similar and unable to really make a connection with how we are going to look at predictability of earthquakes due to precipitation patterns.  Understanding the predictability of earthquakes through various processes may prepare us for understanding the best and most accurate approach for understanding the data.  We know that Poisson and Gamma relationships do not accurately identify the ETAS data or help us benefit from analysis.  The Poisson relationship is not helpful for understanding our predictions.  

Looking at the most recently completed homework assignment; we have solidified the necessary clarity and direct protocols that are a must for understanding reproducibility.  As each group was able to rerun our peers' data and practice the material on our own machines, problems became more and more apparent between assumptions we all make without being cognizant.  Looking at the projects as if a robot, without any prior knowledge of the assignment or knowledge of material, the analysis of other's was clarified and opened up for greater interpretation.  Preparing a project's analysis with narrow and direct parameters is necessary to qualifying a reproducible piece of work at any time.

This week's assignment of mining and visual analysis of earthquake data will help us produce a clear understanding of our final project's earthquake data.  The steps leading up to the final project will be crucial in the perfection of analysis and reproducibility techniques.
