_Models, Ways of Understanding the Data_

-----

Breaking down into smaller sub-groups of our larger horizontal groups makes more sense for accomplishing the final project than smaller groups of individuals unable to lean on each other for necessary collaboration.  Separating ourselves into individual groups was helpful for understanding the bigger scope of our final class project.  The mild homework assignments to get an brief grasp on the necessary topics and libraries we will be accessing of the next few weeks are key to understanding how we are looking at earthquake data, and what we should try to understand through multiple methods.

The Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model and Earthquake-Alarm model are two ways of understanding if there is a predictable link between earthquakes and predicts future events.  Creating a model to mimic these models' most accurate indicators and emphasizing the element magnitude as a source of information is how we will provide accurate indications of future earthquakes.  Using earthquakes and pre-shocks as an indicator of when to trigger an alarm, and the individual magnitude as the length of an alarm.   To minimize the cost of continuously holding an alarm in place would completely call in all earthquakes with no chance of missing an event.  Continuously holding the alarm off would also inaccurately misunderstand all earthquakes over time.  A fine balance between the two is what we hope to accomplish with our new model and produce a simpler model in time.
