**Weekly Reflection**

_Visual Representations
Where We Stand in the Class: Administrators, Entrepreneurs, Integrators, & Producers_

_Earthquakes, Data Analysis & Understanding Data_

-----

With our second homework due date coming up, there is a lot of insight regarding the data analysis-learning ladder.  The division of roles within smaller and larger groups is a process of understanding that will be very helpful in the process of computing our Questionnaire data.

For the Questionnaire data, the division of roles are broken down as so:  Administrators, Producers, Entrepreneurs, & Integrators.  Each of their roles produces integral portions of the division of data and development of analysis in various ways.  Producing and presenting data promptly will identify our detailed understanding of comparing the VARK scores of our classmates with another value within the data table.  As a group, we would like to understand how we can compare the VARK scores and then see how we choose and portray ourselves in-group work settings.  Seeing how we are understood in a test versus how we see ourselves will shed some insight regarding the hierarchy of group work and ourselves.

Particularly, the pipeline of communication and analysis, our group structure of four is cross-listed along all twelve groups in our entire class by unique position and role.  Personally, I was placed as a producer, but see myself more along the lines of a presenter and administrator.  While I like to compute and crunch numbers, seeing my work overall is more rewarding.  Developing visual representations of data is interesting and the process of manipulating numbers to present various situations and reach different goals, I find more fun to present ad talk about.  I understand the positions of Producer and Entrepreneur are crucial in understanding the data, yet behind the scenes and lacking credit.  The ability to compute this information is invaluable, yet sometimes frustrating when incorrectly presented or broadcasted.

Having multiple people within a group are helpful in introducing the multiple points of view and value represented within data.  Unfortunately, sometimes too many people are a hindrance to the discussion of information and concise portrayal of information.

Professor Stark's conversation today regarding the various analogies to understand and compare similar processes was really enlightening.  The relationship between various analysis processes where one may believe the relationship to earthquake predictability would be substantial yet ruled unofficial helped to identify what we will be doing with the earthquake, condensation predictability data.

The simple examples chosen were quite interesting, yet in addition to the Urn Model, L'Aquila scientist debacle, and our own Freedman's Rabbit-Hat Theorem all pointed out important facets of the analysis of data.  Testing predictions with a M8 Algorithm may prove to be our best indication of understanding where tips can highlight higher rates of probability or an earthquake occurring. Other ways we may be able to look at the data will be through a Parimutuel Payoff and evaluating the data as a part of weather predictions.  Like a racetrack, the Parimuteul Payoff will help us examine the professor in Asia's predictions based upon condensation patterns and earthquake predictability.
