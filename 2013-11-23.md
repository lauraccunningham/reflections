**Weekly Reflection**

_Combining Analyzer Skills_

-----

Putting together the multiple groups in Analyzers together has helped tremendously  split up the work into more manageable sections.  By putting 8 heads together, the organization gets a little more confused, yet is still able to understand our main objectives and more easily complete our project.  The current time constraints regarding the December 12th deadline keep us on a quick and straight timeline that leaves us little time to for correcting errors.

Our two original groups have cohesively combined to produce more detailed work and were able to really get some good work rolling over the course of our class time this past Thursday.  Again, we hope to see this upcoming Tuesday's class time spent as a working period while also meeting with Fernando Perez.  I was really excited to see he was coming to speak last Thursday, and I hope after rescheduling, the father of iPython can come and speak with us before the end of the semester.  Who knows, his presence may inspire or push us into looking at the project from a different perspective.
