**Weekly Reflection**

_Groups & the Class Objective_

-----

Varying personalities can benefit a group's dynamic as well as be there demise in certain situations. At this time, our group is opening serious faults due to differences in goals and previous experiences.  Individual personalities influence our priorities and how we are comfortable in going around completing the assignment are where our group is falling apart.  The ability to work together cohesively is hindered by the facts that we all have different starting points in understanding computer languages (i.e. Python & R).

As I understand at this time, the point of our class is to explore reproducibility and data science within the scope of **statistics**, not computer programming.  The steps we are taking to understand these topics include elements of computer programming that help to provide new ways of examining data and sharing more transparently our analysis, but individuals are too focused on these details rather than hammering out our project.
