**Weekly Reflection**

_iPython Notebook, Google Forms, Understanding and Organizing SpreadSheet Data_

-----

We are all caught up and able to run iPython Notebook properly on our individual machines.

_The Importance of Reproducibility_:

Experiments alone can be very impacting and valuable to research, but in conjunction with large numbers of subject, standardized protocols, their results should hold true in any environment or setting across the spectrum.  Granted variation is inevitable, but the ability to reproduce an experiment and see the same results only empowers the weight and experiment may carry.

Reproducibility can help hold an experimentâ€™s value in a conversation or emphasize the results it has relative to the point an individual is trying to focus on.  Having anyone in the world is able to reproduce an experiment or process of producing data identifies the distinctly unique way of standardizing a process. With our class, the ability to itemize our steps, define our goals, and help move along our semester timeline are all important.   Producing an open data source platform on GitHub has allowed us to open our class to the worldwide, Internet community.  If we are able to accurately portray our class actions and results online through developing accurate reproducible steps, any one outside of the Berkeley community should be able to follow along and understand exactly what we are accomplishing.  They too may even be able to add themselves to the discussion in order to open up the conversation and allow them to critique, help, and work alongside in our research.

**Recap**: 

_How to fix the issue of accountability and promptness regarding weekly reflections?_

Weekly questions to guide our reflections should sent out after class on Thursday and will act a s a reminder to the work we are to be completing each week, as well as the upcoming reflection due on Saturdays.  A guiding question would also help direct our reflections so that we are all approaching the same goal(s), and being held accountable.  Open-ended question leaves us without resolve in our progress over the semester.

_A class wide goal of producing a publishable amount of work._

Hopefully we will be able to provide some information regarding the earthquake v. condensation relationship brought to us by Professor Stark.  The lofty goal of producing a publishable amount of work would be a great feat and substantial coordination between Aaron Culich, our GSIs, and the 40+ students in the class.  Ideally, this would be great, yet may be a bit impractical if we are considering this as an experimental class.  In future semesters, this would be achievable as a semester project, but we are still working out kinks along the way.

======
- [ ] Getting iPython Notebook up and running properly
      - Run Virtual Machine (VM) (computer _stat157_)
      - Log into your account
      - Run command, `ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 -no-browser`

      - Open Internet server ( _Safari_ ), and open `127.0.0.1:7777`

      - **You should be properly running iPython Notebook now on your individual computer.**

- [ ] Downloading **gspread**, a necessary part of parsing our spreadsheet data

   - Within your VM terminal,
   - Run command, `sudo apt-get install python-pip`

   - **Problem**:	_sudo_ and _pip_ are unable to be found
   - To fix, run the following commands
      - `sudo apt-get update`
      - `sudo apt-get install python pip`
      - `sudo pip install gspread`

      _You will not need to complete the problem troubleshooting if your terminal runs properly after the first command_

- [ ] Google Form & iPython Notebook:
   - Open iPython Notebook
   - Open class page on GitHub: github.com/stat157
   - Go into 
      - > `fall-2013`
      - > `topic-sketch.md`
      - > open Google Form link

	  _Your iPython Notebook should now be picking up your Google Form_
