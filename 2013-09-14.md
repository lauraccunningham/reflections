**Weekly Reflection**

Running Ubuntu, Vagrant, Virtual Box

------

Getting the iPython Notebook to correctly open in my internet window has been a challenge for me.  There is a computing problem with the SSH access to the Ubuntu server running within my Virtual Box.  Hopefully, the process will be clarified in class next week.  Operating Vagrant confuses me a little bit right now, but hope to have all my questions clarified in the next few sessions.

At this time, there seems to be a lofty goal of publication, yet a little lack of organization as well as coordination in making the best of our time in class together.  Next week our schedule includes guest speakers and data science specialists, so I look forward to hearing their stories, about their projects, and the hopeful part our class will take in parsing the data and identifying the outcome of earthquake data.

I look forward to working with Professor Stark and the mentioned earthquake data he spoke about the first week.  Eric Berlow's field research on frogs, native fish, and local meadows and lakes within Yosemite Valley will give me a closer look at the process of parsing data for this class in the future.
