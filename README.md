Weekly Reflections, due Saturdays by 1700


-----

Bloggers block?  Here are some suggestions on topics to address for your weekly reflections assignment.

Questions to consider:

- What topics this week have been challenging?  How so?  How are you working towards understanding it?  What was worked, and what has not, in working towards understanding it?  Are there others who are helping?

- Did you have an, ?Aha!? moment this week?  How was it before and after that moment?   How did it change your worldview (e.g. stating to notice certain patterns outside of context)? If you encounter someone who faced the same challenge that you just overcame, how would you explain it, in order to lessen the distance you just traveled?

- If you could start this week over, is there a different approach you would have taken towards learning the material?  How would you consider applying this next week and the weeks to follow?  Any advice you would give to students still working out the material in how to approach it?


Bringing in External Media:

Hyperlink videos, news articles, blogs, other class material/readings, etc. that relate to topics covered in this course that strengthens your understanding of the material.
