_Completing Earthquake Analysis_

-----

We have completed our analysis of earthquake data, produced error diagrams, and cleaned our data to a substantially clean level.  Up until now, we have learned multiple ways of going about information to clean and clear up any undefensible statistical situations by easily fitting models to scatter plots, etc.  The work we have executed as a group has helped us to produce a clearer bundle of information that improves the condition of our data by examining the ideas and functions of parameters rather than the value(s) and expected value(s) of our inputs.

Going over the data multiple times has given us insight on the process of contructing earthquake models, and defined more accurated what each type of model specifically does and maintains.  Our final code will be completed in its entirity this week allowing for us to write out clear and concise directions for reproducibility.
