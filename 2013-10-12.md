**Weekly Reflection**

_Questionnaire & Data Wrangling, Presentations, & Take Always_

-----

This week has been an especially interesting and reaffirming to the core concepts this class emphasizes. Reproducibility, and clear logical steps even among our group members has proven to be difficult and without ease.  Varying degrees of installations, setups, and preferences have pushed us into a little bit of a jog in how we are going to be approaching the data.  Finally, in the end, we were able to clearly understand our information and produce a clear rubric in displaying the process and outcome of our homework assignment.  The biggest mistake I believe we encountered was not originally taking an inventory of our individual skill sets and putting them to the most efficient use throughout the process.  If we had looked at our skill sets prior to jumping in, we may have produced a very different representation of the data.  To look around our group and see where our skills would be most effective would have shifted around our roles, and in hindsight, an easier job as producing our outcome.  Because our instructors determined our pre-designated roles, I'd advise some leniency and ability to manipulate the groupâ€™s structures in order to achieve a more efficient team dynamic.

**Fail Early, Fail Often, & Fail Gracefully**

One affirmation emphasized by Aaron would have be, **Fail Early, Fail Often, & Fail Gracefully** if able to.  With this, we really get down to the process of producing reproducible data.  You have to put in something and result in an error in order to learn how we can do something properly and change for clarity.  Pushing data, and running it following the designated guidelines beginning from the start on various machines helped us see where we were going wrong and how we can fix these errors.

**Perfection & Efficiency v. Mindful & Sufficient**

Identifying the difference between **Perfection & Efficiency** and **Mindful & Sufficient** have become mantras in the process of developing the data.  Specifically, I've learned _the devil is in the details_, and with these problems we have slowly been running into over time, the changes necessary to make in order to present clear information is working through the foundations of our programming principles and working very shallow.  With no complex and complicated data structures, we can develop easily readable data that is universally understood.  As goes for our analysis and visualizations, the code necessary to present our information needs to only be sufficient to present the bare bones before integrating new ideas and more complicated dictionaries.  Getting complicated and complex can be in the condensing of data after the necessary ingredients to produce our outcome has been created.
