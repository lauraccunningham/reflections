_Speaker Series: Eric Berlow & Professor Phillip Stark_

Tuesday:	Eric Berlow

Hearing about the process of looking at the data of frogs/toads prevalent in the meadows of Yosemite was eye opening in understanding how to determine relevance, accuracy, and the value of standards across mediums in a range of situations.  The understanding of data was crucial in his case as he was looking at the potential legal implications of the future park service and stock trails working within the park.  Seeing how his original data turned out to highlight another facet of the park's poor choices to introduce foreign aquatic species to lakes and ponds within the park has hindered the native plants and animals' prosperity.  His way of parsing the data and identifying key points of interest visually by layering maps have produced key information in developing new ideas buried within the data.

Thursday:	Professor Phillip Stark

Looking at the data sent to Professor Stark by an individual in Asia, we will be able to see if there is a relationship between precipitation and earthquake prevalence around the world.  After taking a breadth requirement class here at Berkeley about earthquakes and weather science, I feel that there wont be a direct correlation between precipitation and earthquakes as tectonic plate movement occurs much deeper than any precipitation can penetrate the earth surfaces as well as the epicenter locations usually.  To examine climate types and the occurrences within certain regions, I believe we would be able to understand more fully the exact impact this individual is trying to prove.

To expose the data in the earthquake data and possibilities of relationships within the information given to us will be interesting and promising to understand the hypotheses of our Asian counterpart.  Providing visual information and values will make our job of examining the data more efficient and universally understood.
