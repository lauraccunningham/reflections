**Weekly Reflection**

_Getting Everything in Sync & on the Way to Completing the Project_

-----

Setting a timeline is crucial to the sucess of our class with this project.  Without understanding our end goal, we can't figure out the proper ways of setting smaller goals and progress reports to complete the project.  As stated throughout my peers' reflections and many others in class, a syllabus is necessary to understabt the class objective.  Again, the way we've been conditioned with classes, is through a syllabus and smaller homework assignments weekly to undersand the entire course layout.

If able to reassess the class at this point, there would be a clear cut timeline of expectations and needed requirements from our advisors.  A course timeline may look like this for future endeavors with expanding the course - the length of assignments should be coordinated as such:
- Intorduction (**1** Week)
- Course Set-Up & Preparation (**2** Weeks)
- Short Assignments (**6** Week)
- Semester, Term Project (**6** Weeks)
- Conclusion & Presentation (**1** Week)
