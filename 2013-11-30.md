**Weekly Reflection**

_Presentations & Thanksgiving Break_

-----

The presentation by Fernando Perez & information from Professor Stark helped us in further developing our understanding of the iPython notebook.  Clarifying iPython capabilities, and further manipulation possible to make a fully functioning presentation platform for our end result.

We have nearly completed our portion of analyzing the data, and from here on out, we will need to continue checking, cleaning, and formatting our data so that it is completely reproducible and clear if further collaboration is needed.
